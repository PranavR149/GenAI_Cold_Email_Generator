# Project Description
The Cold Email Generator is an intelligent job application assistant that scrapes job descriptions from provided URLs, extracts key job roles and required skills using a powerful language model, and generates personalized cold emails tailored to the job opportunity. The application starts by ingesting the content of a job listing web page and cleaning it to remove irrelevant elements like HTML tags and special characters. It then utilizes a LangChain pipeline powered by the Groq-hosted LLaMA 3 model to extract structured job postings, including the role, experience, skills, and description. To make the cold email more impactful, the system cross-references the extracted skills with a vector database of GitHub project links using ChromaDB. This vector store is built by embedding project tech stacks and associating them with their URLs, enabling semantic similarity search. When matched projects are found, they are appended to the email generated by the model, highlighting the candidateâ€™s relevant work. This makes each email highly personalized and demonstrative of actual experience, greatly increasing the chances of recruiter engagement. The app is deployed using Streamlit, making it accessible via a simple web interface where users can input job listing URLs and instantly generate professional outreach messages.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Groq (LLaMA 3), ChromaDB, Pandas, HTML/CSS, dotenv.
